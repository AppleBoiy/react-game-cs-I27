# Words Confuse

Welcome to Words Confuse by [CS-I27 Team](https://github.com/orgs/CSCMU-65s/teams/mycos-camp-i27/members)! This project
is part of the Computer Skills Training Camp organized by [MycosTech]. The
goal
of this project is to create a simple game using React.js. The game is inspired by hangman and wordle.

## Description

The React Game CS-I27 is a web-based game built using React.js. The game utilizes the `random-words` package to generate
random words for the player to guess. The word meanings are obtained from
the [DictionaryAPI](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en).

The main features of the game include:

- Random word generation
- Word meaning retrieval from DictionaryAPI
- User interface for guessing the word
- Hangman-style gameplay mechanics

## Installation

To install and run the React Game CS-I27 locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-game-cs-I27.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-game-cs-I27
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the game is running, follow the on-screen instructions to play. The objective of the game is to guess the random
word generated by the game. You can enter letters or words in the input field to make your guesses.

The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or incorrect. Additionally, you can view the meaning of
the word by clicking on the respective button.

Try to guess the word correctly within the given number of attempts to win the game!
